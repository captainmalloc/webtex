# webtex Cappuccino based Latex WebApplication

WebTex is a project aiming to propose an online LaTex editor. 
As the web is evolving, new word processors are being proposed as on-line web applications. 
Google Docs are Windows Live are some examples. 
What about LaTex community? WebTex proposes to fill this gap, 
by allowing user to create/edit/compile/print your latex documents 
without the needs to install the latex compiler on local. 
It offers a multi-users and multi-documents environment  proposing a desktop-like interface. 
You can create a new document, add your styles, your images and compile the resulting PDF by simply pressing 3 buttons. 
By registering, you will have a private directory to store your documents; 
otherwise you are free to use the public pool (Guest user).
