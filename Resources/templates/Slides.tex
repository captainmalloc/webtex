%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%===Slide 1 using COLOR
%		sample usage:  \textcolor{blue}{Here you put text.}
\begin{slide}
\begin{itemize}

\item You can put figures and tables into slides,
	using the \verb9\includegraphics{}9 command
	and the {\tt tabular} environment,
	{\em but}

\item you can't use the {\bf figure} and
	{\bf table} environments;
	\LaTeX{} won't number and caption
	figures and tables.

\item Predefined colors are          % COLORS!!!!
        \textcolor{blue}{blue}, \textcolor{red}{red}, \textcolor{black}{black},
        \colorbox{blue}{\textcolor{white}{white}},
        \textcolor{cyan}{cyan}, \textcolor{magenta}{magenta},
        \textcolor{yellow}{yellow}, \textcolor{green}{green}.

        Define colors?  Colored formulae?  You bet!
          \verb2\definecolor{darkgreen}{rgb}{0,0.4,0}2
                \definecolor{darkgreen}{rgb}{0,0.4,0}
        \\ \textcolor{darkgreen}{$A = \pi r^2$}:
